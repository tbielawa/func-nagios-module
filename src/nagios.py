    """
    Perform common tasks in Nagios related to downtime and
    notifications.

    The complete set of external commands Nagios handles is documented
    on their website:

    http://old.nagios.org/developerinfo/externalcommands/commandlist.php

    This module differs from the standard external command API in that
    methods that operate on specific services expect a list of
    services. This deviation is so operations on subsets of a given
    hosts services can be performed in one call.

    Examples:

    import func.overlord.client as fc
    nagios_server = fc.Client("nagios.mydomain.com")

    # Schedule 1 hour of downtime for the http service on www01.
    nagios_server.schedule_svc_downtime("www01.ext.mydomain.com",
          services=["http"], minutes=60):

    # Schedule 30 minutes (default) of downtime for the rsync
    # and nfs services on filer05.
    nagios_server.schedule_svc_downtime("filer05.int.mydomain.com",
          services=["rsync", "nfs"]):

    # Schedule 30 minutes (default) of downtime the foobar host.
    nagios_server.schedule_host_downtime("foobar.mydomain.com")

    # Reenable notifications for all services on the foobar host.
    nagios_server.enable_host_svc_notifications("foobar.mydomain.com")

    # Disable notifications for the foo and bar services on the
    # megafrobber host.
    nagios_server.disable_svc_notifications("megafrobber.mydomain.com",
          services=["foo", "bar"])
